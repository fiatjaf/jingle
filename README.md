jingle
======

A Nostr relay that can be easily customized with The JavaScript.

## How to run it

If you have a Go compiler you can install it with

```
go install github.com/fiatjaf/jingle@latest
```

### Docker
There is a `Dockerfile` and a `sample-docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to run jingle in a docker container.


Otherwise you can get a binary from the [releases](../../releases) page and then calling `chmod +x ...` on it.

Then run it from the shell with `jingle` (or whatever is your binary called):

```
~> jingle
INF checking for scripts under ./stuff/
INF storing data with sqlite under ./data/sqlite
INF checking for html and assets under ./stuff/
INF running on http://0.0.0.0:5577
```

This will create a `./data` and a `./stuff` directories under the current directory.

- `./data` is where your database will be placed, with all the Nostr events and indexes. By default it will be an SQLite database under `./data/sqlite`, but you can also specify `--db lmdb` or `--db badger` to use different storage mechanisms.
- `./stuff` is where you should define your custom rules for rejecting events or queries and subscriptions. 2 JavaScript files will be created with example code in them, they are intended to be modified without having to restart the server. Other files can also be put in this directory. These are the possibilities:
  - `reject-event.js`: this file should `export default` a function that is called on every `EVENT` message received should return a string with an error message when that event should be rejected and `null` or `undefined` when the event should be accepted.
  - `reject-filter.js`: same as above, but refers to `REQ` messages instead.
  - `index.html` and other `.html` files: these will be served under the root of your relay HTTP server, if present, but they are not required.
  - `icon.png`, `icon.jpg` or `icon.gif`, if present, will be used as the relay NIP-11 icon.

### More about `reject-event.js` and `reject-filter.js`

**Promises**

The functions exported from `reject-event.js` and `reject-filter.js` can also return `Promise(string)` or `Promise(null)` in order to reject or accept the requests, respectively.

**Function parameters**

They both take 3 parameters, in the following order:
  - `event`: the event being written, for `reject-event.js`; or `filter`: the subscription filter, for `reject-filter.js`.
  - `relay`: an object with some fields:
    - `query()`, a function that can be called with any Nostr filter and will return an array of results with events (read from the local database)
    - `store`, an interface for storing ephemeral data (will be stored in memory and cleaned up when the server stops), provides these functions:
      - `get(key)`
      - `set(key, value)`
      - `del(key)`
  - `conn`: an object with some fields:
    - `ip`, the IP address of the user, as a string
    - `pubkey`, the public key of the user, as hex, if the user has performed authentication, otherwise `undefined`
    - `getOpenSubscriptions()`, a function that returns an array of filters forall the subscriptions opened by this connection
    - `store`, an interface for storing data associated with this connection, provides these functions:
      - `get(key)`
      - `set(key, value)`
      - `del(key)`

**Authentication requests**

The functions can prompt a client to authenticate using the NIP-42 flow anytime by return a string that starts with `"auth-required: "` (and then some human-readable message afterwards). If the client performs an authentication and make a new request the `pubkey` will be set in the `conn` parameter.

### Other options

Call `jingle --help` to see other possible options. All of these can also be set using environment variables. The most common ones will probably be `--name`, `--pubkey` and `--description`, used to set basic NIP-11 metadata for the relay.

### Trying it

Since you are already in the command line you can download https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak and try writing some events or queries to your relay.
